# Project Hosting and Visibility Platform. 💻

This web application serves as a portfolio platform for users, enabling them to showcase their projects seamlessly. Instead of manually curating a portfolio, users can simply link their profile on this platform.

## Features

- Project Showcase: Users can display their projects with thumbnail images. Clicking on a project thumbnail leads to the project's detailed page, featuring images, videos, team member list, repository link, description, production time, and more.

- User Profile: Users can personalize their profiles with typical portfolio information such as experience, tech stack, personal description, and contact details.

- Project Collaboration: Users can propose project ideas, and others can apply to participate in those projects, fostering collaboration and community building.

## Purpose

This platform aims to streamline the recruitment process for recruiters and simplify project collaboration for users. With easy access to portfolios and the ability to connect with registered users, recruiters can efficiently find suitable candidates. Additionally, users can easily join or form project teams, enhancing their collaborative opportunities.
